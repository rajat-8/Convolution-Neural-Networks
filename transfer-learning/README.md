# Introduction
This notebook contains the example of the transfer learning in keras

# Datasets

In this we used the VGG16 model with its bottle neck features. I couldn't upload those datasets in this repository as their size is too big
to be uploaded . So . I've provided a link [here](https://s3-us-west-1.amazonaws.com/udacity-aind/dog-project/DogVGG16Data.npz)

Similarly, for the dataset . So it could be downloaded individually, the link is [here](https://s3-us-west-1.amazonaws.com/udacity-aind/dog-project/dogImages.zip)

# Instructions

Separate instructions and links are also provided inside the notebook wherever it was needed.

I have used tensorflow-gpu v1.14 as I've dedicated
gpu so the runtime could differ in your workstation.
